# Architecture Decisions

These are the main technical choices behind Vera's current architecture. Earlier decisions were made during the initial spike phase, and later retrieval work was folded into the same benchmark-driven process.

| Area | Choice | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Language | Rust | [001](001-implementation-language.md) |
| Storage | SQLite + sqlite-vec + Tantivy | [002](002-storage-backend.md) |
| Embedding | Qwen3-Embedding-8B (API), Jina v5 nano (local) | [003](003-embedding-model.md) |
| Chunking | Symbol-aware via tree-sitter AST | [004](004-chunking-strategy.md) |
| Retrieval | BM25 + Vector + RRF + Query-aware ranking + Reranking | [005](005-query-aware-retrieval.md) |

Spike code lives in `spikes/`.
